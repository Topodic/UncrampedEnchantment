# Uncramped Enchantment

No more tiny cramped enchantment setups - at last your enchanting table can see further (or closer, if you're crazy) than two blocks. Configurable to have a range of up to 16 blocks up, down, and all around, with sensible defaults that won't mess with your current setup.

This mod uses the [Stonecutter template](https://github.com/stonecutter-versioning/stonecutter-template-architectury) for the [Architectury API](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api) to support Fabric and Forge for 1.20.1, as well as Fabric and NeoForge for 1.21.1. This is my first time working with Java, so please report any issues if you encounter any.
